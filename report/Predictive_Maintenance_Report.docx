PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE SYSTEM USING MACHINE LEARNING
1. Introduction

Predictive maintenance is an advanced maintenance strategy that uses data-driven techniques to predict equipment failures before they occur. Unlike traditional reactive or preventive maintenance, predictive maintenance helps reduce unexpected breakdowns, minimize downtime, and lower maintenance costs.

In modern industries such as manufacturing, aviation, and energy, machines are equipped with multiple sensors that continuously monitor operational conditions. Analyzing this sensor data using machine learning enables early detection of degradation patterns.

Objective of this Project:
The objective of this project is to develop an end-to-end machine learning–based predictive maintenance system that predicts imminent machine failure using sensor time-series data.

2. Dataset Description

This project uses the NASA C-MAPSS Turbofan Engine Degradation Dataset (FD001).

Dataset Characteristics:

Multivariate time-series sensor data

Data collected from multiple turbofan engines

Each engine operates until failure

Sensors record temperature, pressure, vibration, and operational conditions

Dataset Details:

Total engines: 158

Total records: 20,631

Number of sensors: 21

Each row represents one operational cycle of an engine

The FD001 subset represents stable operating conditions, making it suitable for building and validating predictive maintenance models.

3. Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing was performed to ensure data quality and reliability.

Steps Performed:

Assigned meaningful column names to raw data

Corrected data parsing using whitespace separation

Removed constant (non-informative) sensors

Ensured correct data types for engine ID and cycle count

Saved cleaned data for reproducibility

Removing constant sensors reduced noise and improved model learning efficiency.

4. Feature Engineering
Remaining Useful Life (RUL)

Remaining Useful Life (RUL) was calculated for each engine using:

RUL = Maximum Cycle − Current Cycle

Label Creation

The regression problem was converted into a binary classification task:

Failure (1): RUL ≤ 30 cycles

Normal (0): RUL > 30 cycles

This threshold-based approach reflects real-world maintenance decision-making, where failures must be detected in advance.

5. Train–Test Splitting

To avoid data leakage, the dataset was split engine-wise, not randomly.

Why Engine-wise Split?

Multiple records belong to the same engine

Random splitting leaks future information

Engine-wise splitting ensures realistic evaluation

Data was split as:

80% engines for training

20% engines for testing

6. Model Development

Two machine learning models were implemented and evaluated.

6.1 Logistic Regression (Baseline Model)

Used as a baseline classifier

Feature scaling applied

Class imbalance handled using class weights

Provided a benchmark for comparison

6.2 Random Forest Classifier (Final Model)

Captures non-linear sensor degradation patterns

Robust to noise and feature interactions

Handles imbalanced data effectively

Widely used in industrial predictive maintenance systems

7. Model Evaluation
Evaluation Metrics:

Precision

Recall (priority metric)

F1-score

ROC-AUC

Recall was prioritized because missing a failure is more costly than generating a false alarm.

Results Summary:

Logistic Regression provided moderate performance

Random Forest significantly outperformed the baseline

Random Forest achieved very high recall and ROC-AUC on FD001 data

8. Threshold Tuning

The default classification threshold (0.5) was adjusted to improve recall.

Why Threshold Tuning?

Lower thresholds detect failures earlier

In predictive maintenance, early detection is critical

Threshold tuning improved the system’s ability to detect potential failures at the cost of slightly increased false positives, which is acceptable in maintenance scenarios.

9. Feature Importance Analysis

Random Forest feature importance was analyzed to interpret model decisions.

Observations:

A small subset of sensors contributed most to failure prediction

Cycle count and specific temperature/pressure sensors were dominant

Results align with known turbofan engine degradation behavior

This analysis enhances model transparency and trustworthiness.

10. Conclusion

This project successfully implemented an end-to-end predictive maintenance system using machine learning techniques. By leveraging sensor time-series data and Random Forest modeling, the system accurately detected imminent equipment failures.

Key achievements include:

Proper handling of time-series data

Leakage-free model evaluation

High recall-oriented predictive performance

Interpretable and deployable ML solution

The system demonstrates strong potential for real-world industrial maintenance applications.

11. Future Scope

Future enhancements may include:

Testing on more complex datasets (FD002–FD004)

Implementing deep learning models such as LSTM

Real-time deployment using Django or Streamlit

Integration with IoT sensor pipelines
